"""Investigation engine (original Phase 10).

Orchestrates the full investigation workflow end-to-end:
  generate synthetic records -> ingest (adapters) -> extract entities/relationships
  -> resolve duplicates -> build knowledge graph -> run analytics -> summarize.
Operates on the injected graph store (in-memory for tests, Neo4j in prod).
